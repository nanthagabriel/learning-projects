### ᛘ Repo Focus  
This repository will primarily focus on the following areas:

  These are small, hands-on projects designed to practice key programming concepts.

  I’ll share project work and solutions to the course assignments.

### 📅 Regular Updates
- I will be updating this repository regularly, adding new projects, improving old ones and refining my           understanding of core concepts.  
  The focus will evolve throughout the year, depending on the skills I'm developing.
